## Requirements for WearUp Backend (PythonAnywhere deployment)
# These pins are chosen to be compatible and to avoid unnecessary native builds
# - prefer pymysql (pure Python) to avoid compiling mysqlclient on PA

Django==5.2.4
# DRF 3.15+ is compatible with simplejwt 5.x
djangorestframework>=3.15.2,<4.0
djangorestframework-simplejwt==5.5.1
django-cors-headers==4.4.0
Pillow==10.0.1
pymysql==1.0.3
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Optional / commented helpers
# gunicorn==20.1.0         # if you plan to run with gunicorn (not required on PA WSGI)
# mysqlclient==2.2.7       # native MySQL driver (requires system libraries) - use only if you need it
# whitenoise==6.5.0        # if you plan to serve static files with whitenoise

# Notes:
# - On PythonAnywhere it's recommended to install these inside a virtualenv.
# - If you prefer to use `mysqlclient`, replace pymysql with mysqlclient and ensure
#   the mysqlclient system libraries are available on the host.
